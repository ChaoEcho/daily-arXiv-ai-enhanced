The first concern explains the\nfocus on the lifetime of the networks: this dissertation will utilize a fuzzy\nlogic-based clustering protocol with multi-hop transmission for load balancing,\nenergy consumption minimization, and network lifetime prolongation. The\nprotocol forms unequal clusters with cluster head (CH) being selected by fuzzy\nlogic with competition radius. Node distance to the base station,\nconcentration, and residual energy are input variables. The second concern\nfocuses on network stability: we design a type 2 fuzzy logic-based clustering\nschemes in a multi-hop WSN to reduce energy consumption and improve network\nscalability. In this clustering scheme, we propose a cluster head (CH)\nselection strategy where a sensor node is elected as a CH based on type 2 fuzzy\nlogic inputs. To balance the load of CHs we also select their radius size based\non the fuzzy logic inputs. Finally, the third concern is focus on the utility\nof game theory in defensive Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) from selfish nodes\nand malicious behavior. Game theory can effectively model WSNs malicious\nattacks because of their low complexity and scalability. The study, thus,\nexplores different WSN defense strategies from both external attackers and\ninternal nodes acting selfishly or maliciously using the game theory approach.\nAlso, the chapter highlights the general trust model for decision-making using\nthe game theory framework. Besides, the chapter demonstrates the significance\nof the theory in ensuring WSN security from acute attacks and its role in\nenhancing trustworthiness in data and cooperation of nodes in various WSN\narchitectures."}

In\nour approach, images, after being flattened into one-dimensional signals, are\nreconstructed as linear combinations of a set of learned spectral basis\nfunctions, where each basis is explicitly parameterized in terms of frequency,\nphase, and amplitude. The model jointly learns a global spectral dictionary\nwith time-varying modulations and per-image mixing coefficients that quantify\nthe contributions of each spectral component. Subsequently, a simple\nprobabilistic model is fitted to these mixing coefficients, enabling the\ndeterministic generation of new images by sampling from the latent space. This\nframework leverages deterministic dictionary learning, offering a highly\ninterpretable and physically meaningful representation compared to methods\nrelying on stochastic inference or adversarial training. Moreover, the\nincorporation of frequency-domain loss functions, computed via the short-time\nFourier transform (STFT), ensures that the synthesized images capture both\nglobal structure and fine-grained spectral details, such as texture and edge\ninformation. Experimental evaluations on the CIFAR-10 benchmark demonstrate\nthat our approach not only achieves competitive performance in terms of\nreconstruction quality and perceptual fidelity but also offers improved\ntraining stability and computational efficiency. This new type of generative\nmodel opens up promising avenues for controlled synthesis, as the learned\nspectral dictionary affords a direct handle on the intrinsic frequency content\nof the images, thus providing enhanced interpretability and potential for novel\napplications in image manipulation and analysis."}

In this study, building on our recent work\non Monero network detection, we further investigate the network topology of\nMonero's P2P structure, which has evolved following recent protocol updates\nthat enhanced security by obscuring peer information. Using k-core\ndecomposition, we confirm that the Monero network exhibits a core-periphery\nstructure, where a tightly interconnected core of supernodes is crucial for\nmaintaining network cohesion, while peripheral nodes rely on these core nodes\nfor connectivity. This structure explains why targeting central nodes does not\neasily lead to the rapid disintegration of the network's largest connected\ncomponent while also providing a deeper understanding of the true architecture\nof Monero's peer protocol."}

For example, misclassifying\nbenign tumor categories is less consequential, compared to an error at the\npre-cancerous to cancerous threshold, which could profoundly influence\ntreatment choices. Despite this, existing ordinal classification methods do not\naccount for the varying importance of these margins, treating all neighboring\nclasses as equally significant. To address this limitation, we propose CLOC, a\nnew margin-based contrastive learning method for ordinal classification that\nlearns an ordered representation based on the optimization of multiple margins\nwith a novel multi-margin n-pair loss (MMNP). CLOC enables flexible decision\nboundaries across key adjacent categories, facilitating smooth transitions\nbetween classes and reducing the risk of overfitting to biases present in the\ntraining data. We provide empirical discussion regarding the properties of MMNP\nand show experimental results on five real-world image datasets (Adience,\nHistorical Colour Image Dating, Knee Osteoarthritis, Indian Diabetic\nRetinopathy Image, and Breast Carcinoma Subtyping) and one synthetic dataset\nsimulating clinical decision bias.

Despite recent advancements and the success of different\narchitectures, forecasting is often challenging due to non-stationary nature of\nthe real-world data, which frequently exhibit distribution shifts and temporal\nchanges in statistical properties like mean and variance over time. Previous\nstudies suggest that this inherent variability complicates forecasting,\nlimiting the performance of many models by leading to loss of non-stationarity\nand resulting in over-stationarization (Liu, Wu, Wang and Long, 2022). To\naddress this challenge, we introduce a novel architecture, ChoronoAdaptive\nNetwork (CANet), inspired by style-transfer techniques. The core of CANet is\nthe Non-stationary Adaptive Normalization module, seamlessly integrating the\nStyle Blending Gate and Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) (Huang and\nBelongie, 2017). The Style Blending Gate preserves and reintegrates\nnon-stationary characteristics, such as mean and standard deviation, by\nblending internal and external statistics, preventing over-stationarization\nwhile maintaining essential temporal dependencies. Coupled with AdaIN, which\ndynamically adapts the model to statistical changes, this approach enhances\npredictive accuracy under non-stationary conditions. CANet also employs\nmulti-resolution patching to handle short-term fluctuations and long-term\ntrends, along with Fourier analysis-based adaptive thresholding to reduce\nnoise. A Stacked Kronecker Product Layer further optimizes the model's\nefficiency while maintaining high performance.

While these systems\noffer unprecedented efficiency in transporting people and goods, they rely\nheavily on computation capability, safety-critical operations such as real-time\nnavigation, environmental sensing, and trajectory tracking--necessitating\nrobust offboard computational support. A widely adopted solution involves\noffloading these tasks to terrestrial base stations (BSs) along the flight\npath. However, air-to-ground connectivity is often constrained by spectrum\nconflicts with terrestrial users, which poses a significant challenge to\nmaintaining reliable task execution. Cognitive radio (CR) techniques offer\npromising capabilities for dynamic spectrum access, making them a natural fit\nfor addressing this issue. Existing studies often overlook the time-varying\nnature of BS resources, such as spectrum availability and CPU cycles, which\nleads to inaccurate trajectory planning, suboptimal offloading success rates,\nexcessive energy consumption, and operational delays. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a trajectory optimization framework for eVTOL swarms\nthat maximizes task offloading success probability while minimizing both energy\nconsumption and resource competition (e.g., spectrum and CPU cycles) with\nprimary terrestrial users. The proposed algorithm integrates a Multi-Armed\nBandit (MAB) model to dynamically estimate BS resource availability and a Monte\nCarlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to determine optimal offloading decisions,\nselecting both the BSs and access time windows that align with energy and\ntemporal constraints."}

We validate our framework with a modified version of the game\nNim and then apply it to four oversight games: \"Mafia\", \"Debate\", \"Backdoor\nCode\" and \"Wargames\".

In particular, when objects exists as\nsmall pixel-sized entities in a large context of similar objects. Deep learning\napproaches using supervised models with pre-trained weights, such as residual\nnetworks and vision transformers have demonstrated success for many\napplications. Unfortunately, when applied to images outside the domain of\nlearned representations, these methods often result with less than acceptable\nperformance. A strategy to overcome this can be achieved by using\nself-supervised models, where representations are learned and weights are then\napplied for downstream applications. Recently, masked autoencoders have proven\nto be effective to obtain representations that captures global context\ninformation. By masking regions of an image and having the model learn to\nreconstruct both the masked and non-masked regions, weights can be used for\nvarious applications. However, if the sizes of the objects in images are less\nthan the size of the mask, the global context information is lost, making it\nalmost impossible to reconstruct the image. In this study, we investigated the\neffect of mask ratios and patch sizes for blood components using a MAE to\nobtain learned ViT encoder representations. We then applied the encoder weights\nto train a U-Net Transformer for semantic segmentation to obtain both local and\nglobal contextual information. Our experimental results demonstrates that both\nsmaller mask ratios and patch sizes improve the reconstruction of images using\na MAE. We also show the results of semantic segmentation with and without\npre-trained weights, where smaller-sized blood components benefited with\npre-training.

Through a qualitative study combining surveys, LLM interaction\ntranscripts, and in-depth interviews with 14 graduate students, we identify\npatterns in how these emerging professionals assess and engage with\nAI-generated content. Our findings reveal that students construct evaluation\nframeworks shaped by three main factors: professional identity, verification\ncapabilities, and system navigation experience. Rather than uniformly accepting\nor rejecting LLM outputs, students protect domains central to their\nprofessional identities while delegating others--with managers preserving\nconceptual work, designers safeguarding creative processes, and programmers\nmaintaining control over core technical expertise. These evaluation frameworks\nare further influenced by students' ability to verify different types of\ncontent and their experience navigating complex systems. This research\ncontributes to web science by highlighting emerging human-genAI interaction\npatterns and suggesting how platforms might better support users in developing\neffective frameworks for evaluating machine-generated expertise signals in\nAI-mediated web environments."}

Our work addresses two limitations in the current literature.\nFirst, attacks that perform adversarial gradient-based word substitution search\ndo so in the discrete lexical space, while retrieval itself happens in the\ncontinuous embedding space. We thus propose an optimization method that\noperates in the embedding space directly. Specifically, we train a perturbation\nmodel with the objective of maintaining the geometric distance between the\noriginal and adversarial document embeddings, while also maximizing the\ntoken-level dissimilarity between the original and adversarial documents.\nSecond, it is common for related work to have a strong assumption that the\nadversary has prior knowledge about the queries. In this paper, we focus on a\nmore challenging variant of the problem where the adversary assumes no prior\nknowledge about the query distribution (hence, unsupervised). Our core\ncontribution is an adversarial corpus attack that is fast and effective. We\npresent comprehensive experimental results on both in- and out-of-domain\ndatasets, focusing on two related tasks: a top-1 attack and a corpus poisoning\nattack. We consider attacks under both a white-box and a black-box setting.\nNotably, our method can generate successful adversarial examples in under two\nminutes per target document; four times faster compared to the fastest\ngradient-based word substitution methods in the literature with the same\nhardware. Furthermore, our adversarial generation method generates text that is\nmore likely to occur under the distribution of natural text (low perplexity),\nand is therefore more difficult to detect."}

Understanding calibration is\nimportant when the outputs of multiple systems are combined, for assurance in\nsafety or business-critical contexts, and for building user trust in models.\nThis paper provides a comprehensive review of probability calibration metrics\nfor classifier and object detection models, organising them according to a\nnumber of different categorisations to highlight their relationships. We\nidentify 82 major metrics, which can be grouped into four classifier families\n(point-based, bin-based, kernel or curve-based, and cumulative) and an object\ndetection family. For each metric, we provide equations where available,\nfacilitating implementation and comparison by future researchers."}

This paper introduces an\nexplainable AI (XAI) framework that incorporates Shapley Additive Explanations\n(SHAP) to provide deeper insights into how various state parameters influence\nhandover decisions in a DQN-based mobility management system. By quantifying\nthe impact of key features such as reference signal received power (RSRP),\nreference signal received quality (RSRQ), buffer status, and UAV position, our\napproach enhances the interpretability and reliability of RL-based handover\nsolutions. To validate and compare our framework, we utilize real-world network\nperformance data collected from UAV flight trials. Simulation results show that\nour method provides intuitive explanations for policy decisions, effectively\nbridging the gap between AI-driven models and human decision-makers."}

The former determines\nwhen a protocol implementation can be considered buggy, especially when the\nbugs do not cause any observable symptoms. The latter allows developers to\nunderstand how an implementation violates the protocol specification, thereby\nfacilitating bug fixes. Unlike existing works that rarely take both problems\ninto account, this work considers both and provides an effective solution using\nrecent advances in large language models (LLMs). Our key observation is that\nnetwork protocols are often released with structured specification documents,\na.k.a. RFC documents, which can be systematically translated to formal protocol\nmessage specifications via LLMs. Such specifications, which may contain errors\ndue to the hallucination of LLMs, are used as a quasi-oracle to validate\nprotocol parsers, while the validation results in return gradually refine the\noracle. Since the oracle is derived from the document, any bugs we find in a\nprotocol implementation can be traced back to the document, thus addressing the\ntraceability problem. We have extensively evaluated our approach using nine\nnetwork protocols and their implementations written in C, Python, and Go. The\nresults show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art and has\ndetected 69 bugs, with 36 confirmed. The project also demonstrates the\npotential for fully automating software validation based on natural language\nspecifications, a process previously considered predominantly manual due to the\nneed to understand specification documents and derive expected outputs for test\ninputs."}

However, the increased attention has led to an immense variety\nof new notions of \"calibration.\" Some of the notions are incomparable, serve\ndifferent purposes, or imply each other. In this work, we provide two accounts\nwhich motivate calibration: self-realization of forecasted properties and\nprecise estimation of incurred losses of the decision makers relying on\nforecasts. We substantiate the former via the reflection principle and the\nlatter by actuarial fairness. For both accounts we formulate prototypical\ndefinitions via properties $\\Gamma$ of outcome distributions, e.g., the mean or\nmedian. The prototypical definition for self-realization, which we call\n$\\Gamma$-calibration, is equivalent to a certain type of swap regret under\ncertain conditions. These implications are strongly connected to the\nomniprediction learning paradigm. The prototypical definition for precise loss\nestimation is a modification of decision calibration adopted from Zhao et al.\n[73]. For binary outcome sets both prototypical definitions coincide under\nappropriate choices of reference properties. For higher-dimensional outcome\nsets, both prototypical definitions can be subsumed by a natural extension of\nthe binary definition, called distribution calibration with respect to a\nproperty.

In this work, we propose a method called Pseudo-Asynchronous Local SGD\n(PALSGD) to improve the efficiency of data-parallel training. PALSGD is an\nextension of Local SGD (Stich, 2018) and DiLoCo (Douillard et al., 2023),\ndesigned to further reduce communication frequency by introducing a\npseudo-synchronization mechanism. PALSGD allows the use of longer\nsynchronization intervals compared to standard Local SGD.

Encouragingly, LLM-based evaluation, particularly with\nGPT-4, yields the best overall results, and mode-seeking decoding methods seem\nto reduce hallucinations, especially in knowledge-grounded settings. These\nfindings underscore the need for more robust metrics to understand and quantify\nhallucinations, and better strategies to mitigate them."}

In this\npaper, we propose a Two-stage Curriculum Learning loss scheduler (TSCL) for\nbalancing multinomial losses in deep learning image steganography algorithms.\nTSCL consists of two phases: a priori curriculum control and loss dynamics\ncontrol. The first phase firstly focuses the model on learning the information\nembedding of the original image by controlling the loss weights in the\nmulti-party adversarial training; secondly, it makes the model shift its\nlearning focus to improving the decoding accuracy; and finally, it makes the\nmodel learn to generate a steganographic image that is resistant to\nsteganalysis.

Visual CoT remains underexplored, and the only work is based on\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) that relies on extensive labeled bounding-box data\nand is hard to generalize to unseen cases. In this paper, we introduce\nUnsupervised Visual CoT (UV-CoT), a novel framework for image-level CoT\nreasoning via preference optimization. UV-CoT performs preference comparisons\nbetween model-generated bounding boxes (one is preferred and the other is\ndis-preferred), eliminating the need for bounding-box annotations. We get such\npreference data by introducing an automatic data generation pipeline. Given an\nimage, our target MLLM (e.g., LLaVA-1.5-7B) generates seed bounding boxes using\na template prompt and then answers the question using each bounded region as\ninput. An evaluator MLLM (e.g., OmniLLM-12B) ranks the responses, and these\nrankings serve as supervision to train the target MLLM with UV-CoT by\nminimizing negative log-likelihood losses. By emulating human\nperception--identifying key regions and reasoning based on them--UV-CoT can\nimprove visual comprehension, particularly in spatial reasoning tasks where\ntextual descriptions alone fall short. Our experiments on six datasets\ndemonstrate the superiority of UV-CoT, compared to the state-of-the-art textual\nand visual CoT methods. Our zero-shot testing on four unseen datasets shows the\nstrong generalization of UV-CoT. The code is available in\nhttps://github.com/kesenzhao/UV-CoT."}

To this end, a general framework of high-dimensional\nmanifold-based SOFAR inference (SOFARI) was introduced recently in Zheng, Zhou,\nFan and Lv (2024) for interpretable multi-task learning inference focusing on\nthe left factor vectors and singular values exploiting the latent singular\nvalue decomposition (SVD) structure. Yet, designing a valid inference procedure\non the latent right factor vectors is not straightforward from that of the left\nones and can be even more challenging due to asymmetry of left and right\nsingular vectors in the response matrix. To tackle these issues, in this paper\nwe suggest a new method of high-dimensional manifold-based SOFAR inference for\nlatent responses (SOFARI-R), where two variants of SOFARI-R are introduced. The\nfirst variant deals with strongly orthogonal factors by coupling left singular\nvectors with the design matrix and then appropriately rescaling them to\ngenerate new Stiefel manifolds. The second variant handles the more general\nweakly orthogonal factors by employing the hard-thresholded SOFARI estimates\nand delicately incorporating approximation errors into the distribution. Both\nvariants produce bias-corrected estimators for the latent right factor vectors\nthat enjoy asymptotically normal distributions with justified asymptotic\nvariance estimates.

Unlike\ntraditional models, which treat data features independently and overlook their\ninter-relationships, GNNs are designed to capture graph-based structure where\nnodes are interconnected. This relational approach enables GNNs to model\ncomplex dependencies, but it also means that biases can propagate through these\nconnections, complicating the detection and mitigation of individual fairness\nviolations. This PhD project aims to develop a testing framework to assess and\nensure individual fairness in GNNs. It first systematically reviews the\nliterature on individual fairness, categorizing existing approaches to define,\nmeasure, test, and mitigate model biases, creating a taxonomy of individual\nfairness. Next, the project will develop a framework for testing and ensuring\nfairness in GNNs by adapting and extending current fairness testing and\nmitigation techniques. The framework will be evaluated through industrial case\nstudies, focusing on graph-based large language models."}

Extensive\nevaluations on both simulated and experimental data demonstrate that PhyNC\noutperforms existing methods in terms of detail preservation and artifact\nresistance, particularly in low-sensitivity regions. Our approach enhances the\nrobustness of EIT reconstructions and provides a flexible framework that can be\nadapted to other imaging modalities with similar challenges."}

A Gather Head first\nidentifies and extracts relevant information from the context, which an\nAggregate Head then integrates into a final representation. Across both model\ntypes, G&A concentrates in just a few heads, making them critical bottlenecks\neven for benchmarks that require a basic form of retrieval.

However, the\noverhead introduced during the draft phase and the training cost of the draft\nmodel limit the efficiency and adaptability of speculative decoding. In this\nwork, we introduce PARallel Draft (PARD), a novel speculative decoding method\nthat enables low-cost adaptation of autoregressive draft models into parallel\ndraft models. PARD enhances inference efficiency by predicting multiple future\ntokens in a single forward pass of the draft phase, and incorporates a\nconditional drop token method to accelerate training. Its target-independence\nproperty allows a single draft model to be applied to an entire family of\ndifferent models, minimizing the adaptation cost. Our proposed conditional drop\ntoken method can improves draft model training efficiency by 3x. On our\noptimized inference framework, PARD accelerates LLaMA3.1-8B inference by 4.08x,\nachieving 311.5 tokens per second."}

To address the problem, we propose a Joint Uncertainty Learning\nNetwork (JULNet) for high-quality talking face video generation, which\nincorporates a representation of uncertainty that is directly related to visual\nerror. Specifically, we first design an uncertainty module to individually\npredict the error map and uncertainty map after obtaining the generated image.\nThe error map represents the difference between the generated image and the\nground truth image, while the uncertainty map is used to predict the\nprobability of incorrect estimates. Furthermore, to match the uncertainty\ndistribution with the error distribution through a KL divergence term, we\nintroduce a histogram technique to approximate the distributions. By jointly\noptimizing error and uncertainty, the performance and robustness of our model\ncan be enhanced. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves\nsuperior high-fidelity and audio-lip synchronization in talking face video\ngeneration compared to previous methods."}

In this paper, we\ninvestigate the effectiveness of open-source LLMs in extracting key events from\ndischarge reports, such as reasons for hospital admission, significant\nin-hospital events, and critical follow-up actions. In addition, we also assess\nthe prevalence of various types of hallucinations in the summaries produced by\nthese models. Detecting hallucinations is vital as it directly influences the\nreliability of the information, potentially affecting patient care and\ntreatment outcomes. We conduct comprehensive numerical simulations to\nrigorously evaluate the performance of these models, further probing the\naccuracy and fidelity of the extracted content in clinical summarization."}

Aerial+ leverages an under-complete autoencoder to create a neural\nrepresentation of the data, capturing associations between features. It\nextracts rules from this neural representation by exploiting the model's\nreconstruction mechanism. Extensive evaluations on five datasets against seven\nbaselines demonstrate that Aerial+ achieves state-of-the-art results by\nlearning more concise, high-quality rule sets with full data coverage. When\nintegrated into rule-based interpretable machine learning models, Aerial+\nsignificantly reduces execution time while maintaining or improving accuracy."}

In the past, we have typically taken the target distribution as a\ncriterion to evaluate a model's compression performance. Nevertheless,it often\nremains challenging to precisely assess how well the model achieves compression\nand to compare the information content of the learned distribution with that of\nthe target distribution during compression,as the target distribution is\ntypically unknown and entropy computation often incurs exponential cost. In\nthis work, we explore these issues under a controlled experimental setup. We\nfind that Transformers exhibit a unique inductive bias in data compression:\nbeyond approaching the target distribution, they tend to favor learning\nlower-entropy distributions, with this tendency becoming more pronounced as the\nmodel size increases. This preference prevents Transformers from perfectly\naligning with the target distribution, instead further compressing its\ninformation content. Furthermore, we show that the FFN module plays a critical\nrole in driving this bias. In addition, while models remove informational\nredundancy from data during compression, they also exhibit redundancy within\ntheir parameters, which enables compression and can be characterized through\ndynamic sparsity. However, the dynamic sparsity patterns in Transformers,\nparticularly in attention and FFN modules, demand further exploration. As for\nthis, we show that larger Transformers show stronger preferences for bypassing\nattention computations via residual connections and have lower proportion of\nactive neurons. Interestingly, we also find that training instability in larger\nmodels strongly correlates with sudden increases in dead neurons.

We find that both architectures develop the same\nfundamental Gather-and-Aggregate (G&A) mechanism. A Gather Head first\nidentifies and extracts relevant information from the context, which an\nAggregate Head then integrates into a final representation. Across both model\ntypes, G&A concentrates in just a few heads, making them critical bottlenecks\neven for benchmarks that require a basic form of retrieval. For example,\ndisabling a single Gather or Aggregate Head of a pruned Llama-3.1-8B degrades\nits ability to retrieve the correct answer letter in MMLU, reducing accuracy\nfrom 66% to 25%. This finding suggests that in-context retrieval can obscure\nthe limited knowledge demands of certain tasks. Despite strong MMLU performance\nwith retrieval intact, the pruned model fails on other knowledge tests. Similar\nG&A dependencies exist in GSM8K, BBH, and dialogue tasks. Given the\nsignificance of G&A in performance, we show that retrieval challenges in SSMs\nmanifest in how they implement G&A, leading to smoother attention patterns\nrather than the sharp token transitions that effective G&A relies on. Thus,\nwhile a gap exists between Transformers and SSMs in implementing in-context\nretrieval, it is confined to a few heads, not the entire model. This insight\nsuggests a unified explanation for performance differences between Transformers\nand SSMs while also highlighting ways to combine their strengths.

Because each\nsequence-function map can be written as a weighted sum over subsequences in\nmultiple ways, meaningfully interpreting these weights requires \"gauge-fixing,\"\ni.e., defining a unique representation for each map. Recent work has\nestablished that most existing gauge-fixed representations arise as the unique\nsolutions to $L_2$-regularized regression in an overparameterized \"weight\nspace\" where the choice of regularizer defines the gauge. Here, we establish\nthe relationship between regularized regression in overparameterized weight\nspace and Gaussian process approaches that operate in \"function space,\" i.e.\nthe space of all real-valued functions on a finite set of sequences. We\ndisentangle how weight space regularizers both impose an implicit prior on the\nlearned function and restrict the optimal weights to a particular gauge.

We study the following two settings:\n  (i) Self-censoring: An observation $x$ is generated by first sampling the\ntrue value $y$ from a $d$-dimensional Gaussian $N(\\mu*, \\Sigma*)$ with unknown\n$\\mu*$ and $\\Sigma*$. For each coordinate $i$, there exists a set $S_i$\nsubseteq $R^d$ such that $x_i = y_i$ if and only if $y_i$ in $S_i$. Otherwise,\n$x_i$ is missing and takes a generic value (e.g., \"?\"). We design an algorithm\nthat learns $N(\\mu*, \\Sigma*)$ up to total variation (TV) distance epsilon,\nusing $poly(d, 1/\\epsilon)$ samples, assuming only that each pair of\ncoordinates is observed with sufficiently high probability.\n  (ii) Linear thresholding: An observation $x$ is generated by first sampling\n$y$ from a $d$-dimensional Gaussian $N(\\mu*, \\Sigma)$ with unknown $\\mu*$ and\nknown $\\Sigma$, and then applying the missingness model $S$ where $S(y) = {i in\n[d] : v_i^T y <= b_i}$ for some $v_1, ..., v_d$ in $R^d$ and $b_1, ..., b_d$ in\n$R$. We design an efficient mean estimation algorithm, assuming that none of\nthe possible missingness patterns is very rare conditioned on the values of the\nobserved coordinates and that any small subset of coordinates is observed with\nsufficiently high probability."}

ASW utilizes only a shallow decoder\nthat is randomly parameterized and designed to be insensitive to distortions\nfor watermarking extraction. During the watermark embedding, ASW freezes the\nshallow decoder and adversarially optimizes a host image until its updated\nversion (i.e., the watermarked image) stably triggers the shallow decoder to\noutput the watermark message. During the watermark extraction, it accurately\nrecovers the message from the watermarked image by leveraging the insensitive\nnature of the shallow decoder against arbitrary distortions. Our ASW is\ntraining-free, encoder-free, and noise layer-free. Experiments indicate that\nthe watermarked images created by ASW have strong robustness against various\nunknown distortions. Compared to the existing ``encoder-noise layer-decoder''\napproaches, ASW achieves comparable results on known distortions and better\nrobustness on unknown distortions."}

The complexity of estimating 6D poses with such a manifold of\nunknowns led to various datasets, accuracy metrics, and algorithmic solutions.\nThis paper compares datasets, accuracy metrics, and algorithms for solving 6D\npose estimation on the category-level.

For materials with\ncomplex microstructures, such as two-phase random materials (TRMs), material\nfailure is often accompanied by stress concentration. Phase interfaces in\ntwo-phase materials are critical for stress concentration. Therefore, the\nprediction error of stress at phase boundaries is crucial. In practical\nengineering, the pixels of the obtained material microstructure images are\nlimited, which limits the resolution of stress images generated by deep\nlearning methods, making it difficult to observe stress concentration regions.\nExisting Image Super-Resolution (ISR) technologies are all based on data-driven\nsupervised learning. However, stress images have natural physical constraints,\nwhich provide new ideas for new ISR technologies. In this study, we constructed\na stress prediction framework for TRMs. First, the framework uses a proposed\nMultiple Compositions U-net (MC U-net) to predict stress in low-resolution\nmaterial microstructures. By considering the phase interface information of the\nmicrostructure, the MC U-net effectively reduces the problem of excessive\nprediction errors at phase boundaries. Secondly, a Mixed Physics-Informed\nNeural Network (MPINN) based method for stress ISR (SRPINN) was proposed. By\nintroducing the constraints of physical information, the new method does not\nrequire paired stress images for training and can increase the resolution of\nstress images to any multiple. This enables a multiscale analysis of the stress\nconcentration regions at phase boundaries. Finally, we performed stress\nanalysis on TRMs with different phase volume fractions and loading states\nthrough transfer learning. The results show the proposed stress prediction\nframework has satisfactory accuracy and generalization ability."}

The central argument is that a representation is\nlearned from the association between the input X and a context variable A. We\nprove that if an encoder captures the maximum information of this association,\nin which case we say that the encoder learns the contexture, then it will be\noptimal on the class of tasks that are compatible with the context.

Nevertheless,it often\nremains challenging to precisely assess how well the model achieves compression\nand to compare the information content of the learned distribution with that of\nthe target distribution during compression,as the target distribution is\ntypically unknown and entropy computation often incurs exponential cost. In\nthis work, we explore these issues under a controlled experimental setup. We\nfind that Transformers exhibit a unique inductive bias in data compression:\nbeyond approaching the target distribution, they tend to favor learning\nlower-entropy distributions, with this tendency becoming more pronounced as the\nmodel size increases. This preference prevents Transformers from perfectly\naligning with the target distribution, instead further compressing its\ninformation content.

Our data-oblivious\nalgorithms, suitable for online applications, achieve near-optimal distortion\nrates (within a small constant factor) across all bit-widths and dimensions.\nTurboQuant achieves this by randomly rotating input vectors, inducing a\nconcentrated Beta distribution on coordinates, and leveraging the\nnear-independence property of distinct coordinates in high dimensions to simply\napply optimal scalar quantizers per each coordinate. Recognizing that\nMSE-optimal quantizers introduce bias in inner product estimation, we propose a\ntwo-stage approach: applying an MSE quantizer followed by a 1-bit Quantized JL\n(QJL) transform on the residual, resulting in an unbiased inner product\nquantizer. We also provide a formal proof of the information-theoretic lower\nbounds on best achievable distortion rate by any vector quantizer,\ndemonstrating that TurboQuant closely matches these bounds, differing only by a\nsmall constant ($\\approx 2.7$) factor.

We propose Graph of ATtacks (GoAT), a method for generating\nadversarial prompts to test the robustness of LLM alignment using the Graph of\nThoughts framework [Besta et al., 2024].

To\nreduce this challenge, we proposed a novel method that leverages\nself-supervised learning (SSL) and a deep hybrid model, named \\textbf{HybMNet},\nwhich combines local self-attention and fine-grained feature extraction to\nenhance breast cancer detection on screening mammograms.\n  Approach: Our method employs a two-stage learning process: (1) SSL\nPretraining: We utilize EsViT, a SSL technique, to pretrain a Swin Transformer\n(Swin-T) using a limited set of mammograms. The pretrained Swin-T then serves\nas the backbone for the downstream task. (2) Downstream Training: The proposed\nHybMNet combines the Swin-T backbone with a CNN-based network and a novel\nfusion strategy. The Swin-T employs local self-attention to identify\ninformative patch regions from the high-resolution mammogram, while the\nCNN-based network extracts fine-grained local features from the selected\npatches. A fusion module then integrates global and local information from both\nnetworks to generate robust predictions. The HybMNet is trained end-to-end,\nwith the loss function combining the outputs of the Swin-T and CNN modules to\noptimize feature extraction and classification performance.\n  Results: The proposed method was evaluated for its ability to detect breast\ncancer by distinguishing between benign (normal) and malignant mammograms.\nLeveraging SSL pretraining and the HybMNet model, it achieved AUC of 0.864 (95%\nCI: 0.852, 0.875) on the CMMD dataset and 0.889 (95% CI: 0.875, 0.903) on the\nINbreast dataset, highlighting its effectiveness."}

In this paper, we formally define\nthe Platoon Coordination Reward Design Problem (PCRDP), extending the RL-based\ncooperative platoon coordination problem to incorporate automated reward\nfunction generation. To address PCRDP, we propose a Large Language Model\n(LLM)-based Platoon coordination Reward Design (PCRD) framework, which\nsystematically automates reward function discovery through LLM-driven\ninitialization and iterative optimization. In this method, LLM first\ninitializes reward functions based on environment code and task requirements\nwith an Analysis and Initial Reward (AIR) module, and then iteratively\noptimizes them based on training feedback with an evolutionary module. The AIR\nmodule guides LLM to deepen their understanding of code and tasks through a\nchain of thought, effectively mitigating hallucination risks in code\ngeneration. The evolutionary module fine-tunes and reconstructs the reward\nfunction, achieving a balance between exploration diversity and convergence\nstability for training.

In this work, a novel QoS-aware Load Balancing (LB) approach\nis developed to optimize the performance of Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) and Best\nEffort (BE) traffic in a multi-band Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) under QoS\nand resource constraints. The proposed solution builds on Graph Reinforcement\nLearning (GRL), a powerful framework at the intersection of Graph Neural\nNetwork (GNN) and RL. The QoS-aware LB is modeled as a Markov Decision Process,\nwith states represented as graphs. QoS consideration are integrated into both\nstate representations and reward signal design. The LB agent is then trained\nusing an off-policy dueling Deep Q Network (DQN) that leverages a GNN-based\narchitecture. This design ensures the LB policy is invariant to the ordering of\nnodes (UE or cell), flexible in handling various network sizes, and capable of\naccounting for spatial node dependencies in LB decisions.

Modeling and calibration errors are therefore unavoidable, making\nthe transfer of control systems from simulation to real-world systems a\ncritical challenge. Traditional robust controls have limitations in handling\ncertain types of nonlinearities and uncertainties, requiring a more practical\napproach capable of comprehensively compensating for these various constraints.\nThis study proposes a new robust control approach using the framework of deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL). The key strategy lies in the synergy among domain\nrandomization-based DRL, long short-term memory (LSTM)-based actor and critic\nnetworks, and model-based control (MBC). The problem setup is modeled via the\nlatent Markov decision process (LMDP), a set of vanilla MDPs, for a controlled\nsystem subject to uncertainties and nonlinearities. In LMDP, the dynamics of an\nenvironment simulator is randomized during training to improve the robustness\nof the control system to real testing environments. The randomization increases\ntraining difficulties as well as conservativeness of the resultant control\nsystem; therefore, progress is assisted by concurrent use of a model-based\ncontroller based on a nominal system model. Compared to traditional DRL-based\ncontrols, the proposed controller design is smarter in that we can achieve a\nhigh level of generalization ability with a more compact neural network\narchitecture and a smaller amount of training data.

The central argument is that a representation is\nlearned from the association between the input X and a context variable A. We\nprove that if an encoder captures the maximum information of this association,\nin which case we say that the encoder learns the contexture, then it will be\noptimal on the class of tasks that are compatible with the context.

The probabilistic satisfiability problem asks whether a\njoint probability distribution satisfies a Boolean combination of\n(in)equalities over such terms. Fagin et al. (1990) showed that for basic and\nlinear terms, this problem is NP-complete, making it no harder than Boolean\nsatisfiability, while Moss\\'e et al. (2022) proved that for polynomial terms,\nit is complete for the existential theory of the reals.\n  Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH) extends the probabilistic setting with\ninterventional and counterfactual reasoning, enriching the expressiveness of\nlanguages. However, Moss\\'e et al. (2022) found that satisfiability complexity\nremains unchanged. Van der Zander et al. (2023) showed that introducing a\nmarginalization operator to languages induces a significant increase in\ncomplexity.\n  We extend this line of work by adding two new dimensions to the problem by\nconstraining the models. First, we fix the graph structure of the underlying\nstructural causal model, motivated by settings like Pearl's do-calculus, and\ngive a nearly complete landscape across different arithmetics and PCH levels.\nSecond, we study small models. While earlier work showed that satisfiable\ninstances admit polynomial-size models, this is no longer guaranteed with\ncompact marginalization. We characterize the complexities of satisfiability\nunder small-model constraints across different settings."}

This limitation arises from low-pass filtering effects, gate\nbiases favoring stability, and memory update mechanisms that prioritize\nlong-term information retention. To address these shortcomings, this study\nintroduces a hybrid deep learning framework that integrates both long-term\ntrend and short-term fluctuation information using two input features processed\nin parallel, designed to capture complementary aspects of traffic flow\ndynamics. Further, our approach leverages attention mechanisms, specifically\nBahdanau attention, to selectively focus on critical time steps within traffic\ndata, enhancing the model's ability to predict congestion and other transient\nphenomena.

Standard deep\nlearning models often struggle with these challenges because their\narchitectures inherently smooth over fine-grained fluctuations while focusing\non general trends. This limitation arises from low-pass filtering effects, gate\nbiases favoring stability, and memory update mechanisms that prioritize\nlong-term information retention. To address these shortcomings, this study\nintroduces a hybrid deep learning framework that integrates both long-term\ntrend and short-term fluctuation information using two input features processed\nin parallel, designed to capture complementary aspects of traffic flow\ndynamics. Further, our approach leverages attention mechanisms, specifically\nBahdanau attention, to selectively focus on critical time steps within traffic\ndata, enhancing the model's ability to predict congestion and other transient\nphenomena. Experimental results demonstrate that features learned from both\nbranches are complementary, significantly improving the goodness-of-fit\nstatistics across multiple prediction horizons compared to a baseline model.\nNotably, the attention mechanism enhances short-term forecast accuracy by\ndirectly targeting immediate fluctuations, though challenges remain in fully\nintegrating long-term trends.

We present a feasible\nimplementation of MML-based LLMs via leveraging advanced techniques such as\ndisentangled representation learning, neural architecture search and\nneuro-symbolic learning.
